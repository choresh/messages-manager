# Messages Manager

## A) General

1) Messages Manager is application which manages messages and provides details about those
messages, specifically whether or not a message is a palindrome. 

2) A message has the following fields:
    * **id**: primary key, generated by the application.
    * **date**: creation date, generated by the application.
    * **type**: the message type (Palindrome/NoPalindrome), calculated by the application.
    * **payload**: a free string, **this is the only field which client should set**.

2) The exposed WEB API:
    * Create message: 
        * Method: GET
        * URL: http://\<host\>:8080/api/messages
        * Body: {"payload": "\<payload\>"}
        * Query params: N.A.
    * Update specific message:
        * Method: PUT
        * URL: http://\<host\>:8080/api/messages\<message id\>
        * Body: {"payload": "\<payload\>"}
        * Query params: N.A.
    * Delete specific message:
        * Method: DELETE
        * URL: http://\<host\>:8080/api/messages\<message id\>
        * Body: N.A.
        * Query params: N.A.
    * Retrieve specific message:
        * Method: GET
        * URL: http://\<host\>:8080/api/messages\<message id\>
        * Body: N.A.
        * Query params: N.A.
    * Retrieve all/some/sorted messages:
        * Method: GET
        * URL: http://\<host\>:8080/api/messages
        * Body: N.A.
        * Query params: 
            * Get all messages, without filtering/sorting:
                * No query params
            * Get all 'Palindrome' messages:
                * ?type=Palindrome
            * Get all 'NoPalindrome' messages:
                * ?type=NoPalindrome
            * Get all messages, sorted by date, in descending order:
                * ?sort=date:desc
            * Get all messages, sorted by date, in ascending order:
                * ?sort=date:asc
            * It is possible to combine the 'type' and 'sort' queries, e.i. any of those 4 combinations is valid:
                * ?type=Palindrome&sort=date:desc
                * ?type=NoPalindrome&sort=date:desc
                * ?type=Palindrome&sort=date:asc
                * ?type=NoPalindrome&sort=date:asc

3) In order to achive high performance, **calculation of message type (Palindrome/NoPalindrome) performed at backround**. This mean that while client recive a response for creation or updating of a meeesge - the message type is not calculated yet, i.e. **the calculated value will be inserted to DB a bit later, and in the meantime it will have 'null' value**.
This incomplete state of the message will be reflected in 2 places:
    * At response of the relevant creation/updating operation. Here the 'type' will alwys be 'null'.
    * At response to retrieve message(s), or delete message. Here the 'type' may or may not be 'null'.

4) The application may run in 3 deferent environments:
    * **Running the application in the cloud:**
        * Pros:
            * It validate that all works fine in the cloud environment.   
            * It enable to consume the service from all over the world.
        * Cons:
            * Uncomfortable for development process (edit/run/debug).    
    * **Running the application in docker machine:**
        * Pros:
            * No need to install postgres on your machine.
            * It validate that resulted dockerized version is OK.    
        * Cons:
            * Uncomfortable for development process (edit/run/debug).     
    * **Running the application in local machine:**
        * Pros:
            * Comfortable for development process (edit/run/debug).     
        * Cons:
            * Need to install postgres on your machine.
            * It does not validate that resulted dockerized version is OK.

## B) Running the application in the cloud
TODO
      
## C) Running the application in docker machine

### Prerequisite installations:
- Install Docker (e.g. 'Docker Desktop for Windows' - https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).

### Install, build and run the running multi-container Docker applications (Postgres + Messags Manager):
- Go to root folder of the app (the folder where file 'docker-compose.yml' located), and execute the following command:
~~~
docker-compose up --build
~~~
- See the appendix below for some more useful Docker commands.

## D) Running the application in local machine

### Prerequisite installations:
- Install NodeJs - https://nodejs.org/en/download.
- Install Postgres -https://www.postgresql.org.

### Create the 'Postgres' database:
- Open the 'pgAdmin' app (part of the 'Postgres' installation).
- Go to: Databases -> right click -> Create -> DataBase, and create new data base with:
    - name: messages-manager.
    - port: 5432.
    - username: postgres.
    - password: postgres.

### Install, build and run the multi-parts local applications (Postgres + Messags Manager):
- Go to root folder of the app (the folder where file 'package.json' located), and execute the following commands sequence:
~~~
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
~~~

## E) Testing the application

## F) Using the application's CLI

## G) Appendix

### Other useful Docker commands

#### Build the Messages Manager docker image:
~~~
docker build -t messages.manager .
~~~
#### Run the Messages Manager docker container:
~~~
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -P messages.manager
~~~
#### Stop all running docker containers:
~~~
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
~~~
#### Remove all docker containers:
~~~
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
~~~
